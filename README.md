# Part-of-speech-tagging-with-discriminatively-re-ranked-Hidden-Markov-Models
Implemented POS tagging by combining a standard HMM tagger separately with a Maximum Entropy classifier designed to re-rank the k-best tag sequences produced by HMM â€“ achieved better results than VITERBI (decoding algorithm)
